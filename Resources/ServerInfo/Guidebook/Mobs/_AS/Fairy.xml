  Tiny, winged humanoids with a mystical aura. Fairies are delicate but agile. Their small stature makes them elusive, but also fragile. Their small bodies means that a comparitavely small amount of chems for a larger person go much further. Originally a luxury produced species, Faries have since escaped and reproduced, filling air ducts on thousands of staitons with small societies.

  ## Benefits

  - Their wings allow them to accelerate very fast in zero gravity environments.
  - Extremely small size makes them harder to hit in combat.
  - Metabolizes things much more effectively than other species.
  - Can eat sugar to regain blood level.
  - Takes up a very small amount of space in bags.
  - Blood is a powerful narcotic, but be warned, those who imbibe too much are cursed.
  - Low weight means they can propel themselves in space extremely fast.

  ## Drawbacks

  - Crits at 50 damage, dies at 75.
  - Triggers mouse traps.
  - Takes 10x damage from being flung.
  - Struggles to drag things much if at all due to low weight.
  - Animals will, more often than not, try to kill them as though they were a mouse.
